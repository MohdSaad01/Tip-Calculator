# Tip Splitter â€“ My First Python Project

This is a simple Python program that calculates how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including a tip.

## Features

- Takes total bill input
- Accepts tip percentage (10, 12, 15, etc.)
- Calculates total bill including tip
- Splits the bill among a number of people
- Rounds the final amount to 2 decimal places

## How It Works

1. The user enters the bill amount.
2. The user selects a tip percentage.
3. The total amount (with tip) is calculated.
4. The user enters how many people are splitting the bill.
5. The program outputs how much each person should pay.
